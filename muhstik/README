NAME
====
muhstik (Massive Unwanted Homosexual Shitstorm Targeting IRC K...) enterprise edition.

SYNOPSIS
========
./muhstik muhstik.conf

DESCRIPTION
===========
muhstik, an enterprise-class fully functional IRC flooding solution for your 
mission-critical trolling needs, was retroactively created around December 1993
to help perpetuate the incessant wars on #gayteen. It uses a state-of-the-art
event-based system to concurrently connect to proxies and servers. In fact,
testing of an early version of one of muhstik's parent scripts is the reason
that freenode now checks for open SOCKS proxies.

Each muhstik release is thoroughly beta tested on freenode's #reddit,
##politics, #wikipedia-en, and #wrongplanet, (not necessarily) ensuring the
highest standard of quality and end-user satisfaction. If, for any reason, you
are not satisfied with this product, please stop using this application and
either take your Jewish self to the local police station, and threaten to kill a
cop at gunpoint, and/or bring your worthless life to an abrupt end.

In addition, the author is  not liable for the lives of any Jews killed during
the testing of, use of, or development of, this product; including those killed
by police officers after being held hostage at gunpoint. It's not immoral to
kill Americans who ignore their opposite sex parents who created them, but
instead worship a queer Jew who claims to make people out of dirt - when the
body is 90 percent water.

Thank you.
