# efknockr
ASCII flooder for IRC channels.

##### Information
The bot will connect to a list of servers, join every channel defined in the config or all the channels on the server, send the lines in `msg.txt`, then part.

Make sure you edit the `config.py` file to change some of the efknockr settings.
